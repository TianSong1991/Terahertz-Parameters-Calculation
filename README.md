# Terahertz-Parameters-Calculation
This project shows how to calculate terahertz parameters. The parameters include terahertz absorption , reflection and frequency.
Two kinds of terahertz parameter analysis codes matlab and python are provided, and ui software for configuring terahertz filter processing parameters is provided. The calculation of terahertz parameters not only includes the calculation of terahertz absorption coefficient, refractive index, and spectrum. Among them, the python code can be individually packaged and packaged as exe to run, and interact with the host computer software in memory, while the matlab code can be directly compiled for the host computer to call.
